# un coup de dés (du destin)

a short command line game in python, based on the Turing test.

Started at [MUTEK AI Art lab, March 2020](https://mutek.org/en/news/mutek-ai-art-lab).

## about the project

You can [look at the .pdf for the presentation slides](https://github.com/finartcialist/uncoupdedes/blob/master/uncoupdedes.pdf).

This small project is an adventure into the world of randomness, as seen by humans and by machines.

We know that it is difficult to obtain pure random numbers in an algorithmic way (see [random.org](https://www.random.org) for more information), but how difficult is it for humans to be as random as possible ? What is randomness ?

In this inversed Turing test, it is the human that has to prove they are, in fact, a machine...

The first human generates a serie of ten numbers.
The machine accomplish the same thing.

A second human then tries to find the human-created serie amongst the two series.

Are humans the better machines ?
